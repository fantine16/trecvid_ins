The code base for trec_eval_video is trec_eval version 8.1

trec_eval.h has been modified and recompiled to extend the list of
cutoff values beyond 1000 to 2000 to accommodate results sets of up to
2000 items TRECVID accepts in the feature extraction task. It also
holds the max result set size passed when trec_eval is called.

trvec_teval.c has been changed for TRECVID to calculate
non-interpolated average precision by dividing the precision sum by
the max result set size rather than the number relevant iff the number
relevant is greater than the max result set size. 

trec_eval.c has been changed so max result set size can be passed as a
parameter to this version of trec_eval.c. This is for use in TRECVID
where (for features) the number true may be larger than the max result
set size (2000) and for search the number relevant may be more than
1000.
